Implementation of the Code into Verilog

=> Saved and View Binary File -> Converting image to binary file and in binary file format
It is the folder where the matlab codes are available to read the image.

=> picture reading and result (top) -> Reading the picture, processing and
contains the main verilog code for converting the result to binary file
is the folder.

=> rotated grid (main sub) -> corresponding to rotated_grid function in matlab
verilog algorithm, verilog algorithm that finds maximum-minimum values ​​and some sub
It is the folder that contains the algorithms.

=> VerilogTermProject -> Merged modules of top and sub main
Although it has the state, it is the last state folder of the project.

The locations in the code must be set for the code to work.

- We tried to examine the Matlab Code line by line. Some of the works
"MATLAB CODE ANNOUNCEMENT" is saved in the word file. Some information, some in paint
Since it remains in our notebooks, there is no explanation for each line.
In addition, the matlab we wrote in this file to compare the code outputs.
code is also available.

- There are TWO PROJECT PRESENTATIONS in the file. Matlab code in one of the project presentations
the other explains the veirlog code.


- "PROJECT PERORT" project purpose, working stages and project outputs
We wrote in this file.
